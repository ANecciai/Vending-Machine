# Vending-Machine
My first capstone from Tech Elevator after our first four weeks of instruction. While it did function properly, there were some missing edge cases and our code was not as encapsulated as it should have been. I used what I learned from this project, particularly in regards to encapsulation, in my Pop quiz generator (still currently in development).
